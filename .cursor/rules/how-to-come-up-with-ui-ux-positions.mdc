how to come up with best ui/ux positions

what you first do is that to not create a complex layout start from the most important part to be seen by the user and give them percentages based on the importance of the feature

lets say that the most important feature is like 90% it becomes and holds the most ui/ux visible place that is accessible by the user if it is low it can be hidden with drop-downs and much more if they are equal they become an equal cards, tabs, navigation tabs something that is rendered equally use all the ui/ux principles to emphasize and deemphasize

first what you do is to get all the features written down or be in a plan and give them percentages so that you can create layouts
